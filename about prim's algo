Primâ€™s algorithm is a greedy 
algorithm that finds the minimum
 spanning tree (MST) for a connected, 
weighted graph. It starts from a random
 vertex and grows the MST by adding the 
smallest edge that connects a vertex 
inside the MST to a vertex outside it. 
The process repeats until all 
vertices are included in the MST.
